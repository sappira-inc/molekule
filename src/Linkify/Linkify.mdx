# Linkify

Automatically parse links contained in a body of text. All props except for `linkStyle` are passed through directly to [react-markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown), which `Linkify` uses internally.

## Props
<PropsTable of={Linkify} />

## Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const markdownString  = `Checkout http://google.com. <span onmouseover="alert('yo')">Another</span> one that's not so great is http://bing.com. You could also checkout duckduckgo.com if you're into that whole privacy thing. <img src="fake.jpg" onError={() => {}} alt="hacker" /> Oh, and you should also check out https://heydoctor.co. And this [markdown link](https://heydoctor.com)\n\n\    I used to be interpreted as a code block but I shouldn't be anymore!!! And strings can have multiple       spaces      inside`;

    return (
      <Linkify linkStyle={{ color: 'magenta' }} source={markdownString} />
    );
  }}
</Playground>

# Modal

Modals are a great way to add dialogs to your site for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.

## Props
<PropsTable of={Modal} />

## Example

Toggle a working modal demo by clicking the button below. It will slide up and fade in from the bottom of the page.

<Playground>
  <ModalExample body="I am an example modal that displays example content to prove that I can actually do some things" maxWidth={300} />
</Playground>

## Handling Long Content

When modals become too long for the userâ€™s viewport or device, they scroll independent of the page itself.

<Playground>
  <ModalExample body={<div>{new Array(50).fill(null).map((_, i) => <p key={i}>I'm really long annoying content.</p>)}</div>} />
</Playground>

## Handling Dropdown Triggered Content

When modals are triggered by dropdowns with returnFocus set to true, modals still receive focus. 

<Playground>
  <ModalDropdownExample body="I'm triggered by a dropdown" />
</Playground>
